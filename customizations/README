---------------------------------  ConsolePi Example Customizations ---------------------------------

ConsolePi Configures itself with what I hope is the most commonly desired set of functionality.

The Upgrade process verifies some system files match whats in the repo, so that any enhancements that
involved changes to those files will be deployed.  In order to accomodate customization of the system
files involved without ConsolePi interfering during `consolepi-upgrade`.  An override mechanism exists.
To bypass validation of any of the system files/configurations that ConsolePi verifies, place a files
with the same name in the overrides directory.  i.e. `touch rfcomm.service` will skip verification of
the rfcomm systemd unit file.  See the README in the override directory for more info.

This directory is simply a collection of example customizations that some might find useful.  If 
contributing an example please place a comment block at the top explaining what functionality/purpose
use-case etc. it provides.

remember to place a file with the same name in the override directory if using these or any
customizations.
