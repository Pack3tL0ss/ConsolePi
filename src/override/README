override Directory provides a mechanism to provide custom versions of certain files handled by the upgrade script.

Some system files are generated by the installer and verified during upgrade, if they don't match the template (which is generally in the src dir)
they will be replaced with the template version.

This behavior can be bypassed for files you've chosen to make custom modifications to simply by placing a file with the same
name in this Directory.  You can just 'touch' the file it doens't matter if it has any content.
