##### ConsolePi - Off Pi Google Sheets Authorization script for Windows ####

This executable is designed for users that want to deploy the ConsolePi cloud 
function using Google Sheets on a Raspberry Pi that has no desktop environment

A web browser is required to grant ConsolePi permissions.  This exe will allow
you to do that on a separate Windows system, then move the resulting files to 
your ConsolePis.  This step is only required if you deployed ConsolePi using 
without a desktop environment (raspbian-lite) as I do.  If you have a desktop 
environment you can authorize directly on the Raspberry pi from the desktop.  
To do so you would launch a terminal in the desktop environment and enter 
consolepi-menu then select the option to refresh cloud data.  A browser should launch.

# Pre-Requisites:
 - Follow instructions on the github to create a "ConsolePi" project @ https://console.developers.google.com
 - After creating the Oath2 client in the developer console download the client_secret_....json 
 - rename the file credentials.json and place it in the same directory as this executable
 
# Usage:
  - Place The exe on a Windows system (created and tested on Win10).
  - ensure credentials.json is in the same folder as this exe
  - double-click/execute the exe
 
Once Complete you should have the credentials.json and a token.pickle file in the folder
#--> Those 2 files need to be moved to the ConsolePi(s) in /etc/ConsolePi/cloud/gdrive/.credentials <--#

# -- ??What's in the exe?? --
It's the get_credentials function from the gdrive.py script.
A venv was created on a Windows system, dependencies were installed then a single file exe
 was created on/for Windows using pyinstaller

This makes it easy and portable, but if there is concern over using an exe from the wild you could do this different ways.
this is just the easiest.
