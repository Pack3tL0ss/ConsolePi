override Directory provides a mechanism to provide custom versions of certain files handled by the upgrade script.

Some system files are generated by the installer and verified during upgrade, if they don't match the template (which is generally in the src dir)
they will be replaced with the template version.

This behavior can be bypassed for files you've chosen to make custom modifications to simply by placing a file with the same
name in this Directory.  You can just 'touch' the file it doens't matter if it has any content.

The following files are supported by override
    > however weather or not the upgrade modifies the enabled state I need to double check in some scenarios (primarily autohotspot which disables dnsmasq and hostapd services)

[SYSTEM CONFIGURATION FILES]
- dhcpcd.conf
- dnsmasq.conf NOTE: dnsmasq should now only impact wlan0 (unless modified and overriden) there is an eth0 speciffic unit file in /etc/ConsolePi/src/systemd that can be enabled 
    for wired dhcp.  This will be a configuration option in the near future.
- hostapd (/etc/default)
- interfaces (/etc/network)
- hosts (/etc) # /etc/hosts is updated to add the hostname so clients connecting to the hotspot can connect via hostname

[SYSTEMD UNIT FILES]    must include the .service extension
- bluetooth.service
- rfcomm.service
- autohotspot.service
