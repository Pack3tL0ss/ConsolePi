# Lame!! Adapters

## List of Adapters known *not* to work.

*Technically all adapters should work, however some lame adapters don't burn a serial # to the chip.  The serial # is the attribute that is unique to just that adapter.  With no serial number it becomes difficult to identify that adapter uniquely, so mapping it to a friendly predictable name (and associated TELNET port etc.) becomes difficult.*

The listing below shows adapters / chipsets that don't present a serial #

Some Adapters have software utilities making it possible to burn a serial #, if adding to this list please make that note.

# Recommended / Known Working Adapters
Adapters based on the Following chipset vendors present a serial #:
- FTDI

    *I only purchase serial adapters based on FTDI chipsets, others can add to this if they have adapters they know work*
