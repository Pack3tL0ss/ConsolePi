# piwheels is currently not building packages as they move 90% of the less common packages onto cheaper storage
# https://github.com/piwheels/packages/issues/530
# This means more packages will be built during the install.  This is painfully slow for some packages on the Pi Zero
# We have pinned what we can to avoid this pain for now, but can't get around all of it.  i.e. zeroconf will build, but takes forever.
