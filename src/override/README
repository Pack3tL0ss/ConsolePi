override Directory provides a mechanism to provide custom versions of certain files handled by the upgrade script.

Some system files are generated by the installer and verified during upgrade, if they don't match the template (which is generally in the src dir)
they will be replaced with the template version.

This behavior can be bypassed for files you've chosen to make custom modifications to simply by placing a file with the same
name in this Directory.  You can just 'touch' the file it doens't matter if it has any content.

- NOTE: /etc/default/tftpd-hpa is not part of the updgrade, once it's installed the upgrade will just verify it's installed if tftpd=true in the config
  the config is not directly related to ConsolePi functions, so the upgrader doesn't check it once installed.

The following files are currently supported for override
- Feature was just implemented, need to double-check, but should be at or near 100% coverage on support of the override function for system files
